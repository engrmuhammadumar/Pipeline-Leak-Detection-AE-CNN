## 📌 Overview

Pipeline leakage poses a serious risk to environmental and operational safety. This work proposes a novel approach using:

- Acoustic Emission (AE) signal acquisition
- Stockwell Transform (ST) for time-frequency imaging
- Sobel Edge Filtering to enhance leak features
- CNN-based automatic feature extraction and classification
